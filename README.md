# SER for Machine Faults Classification
Sound Event Recognition (SER) for machine faults classification.

At this moment, this project is still in development.

For initial testing purposes, this repository is using audio files from the following repository: https://github.com/RashadShubita/Fault-Detection-using-TinyML

These audio files have the following specifications:
- Sampling Frequency: 48000 Hz
- Bit Depth: 24 bits
- Encoding: FLAC
- Channels: 2 (Stereo)
- Duration: ~ 1 minute per file (~ 5 minutes and 8 seconds in total)

For now, this project is using the following specifications*:
- Sampling Frequency: 16000 Hz
- Bit Depth: 16 bits
- Channels: 1 (Mono)

\* not mentioned specifications here are assumed to be the same as the ones in the audio files.
